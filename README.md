## VitalView

Lung cancer is the second most common cancer. Early detection saves lives, and understanding your health shouldn’t be complicated. VitalView simplifies this process by using AI to analyze scans and highlight potential concerns, while also generating interactive 3D visualizations to make results easier to interpret. 

Our goal is to make medical imaging more accessible, helping both patients and doctors gain clearer insights. By raising awareness and providing better tools for lung health, we’re making early detection easier.

# How it Works

By integrating AI and 3D visualization, we make it easier for patients and healthcare professionals to understand critical health information.

* Upload lung CT scans for real-time analysis
* AI model identifies cancerous regions 
* View interactive 3D model of scan

# Tech Stack

* Frontend: React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
* Backend: PyTorch
* 3D Visualization: Three.js

# What's Next for VitalView?

We would like to expand beyond lung scans to support other medical imaging, such as:
* Heart scans for cardiovascular health
* Brain MRIs for neurological analysis
* Other diagnostic scans to improve early detection in multiple areas
